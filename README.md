# TITLE
Durga Pujo Voting System using PHP & MYSQL

# ABSTRACT OF THE PROJECT

 This project helps us to combine all the previous knowledge that we have
learned in the last 2 years. It involves knowledge of software engineering,
Web development, Database handling, content feeding, Problem-Solving
skills etc...
 When researching topics, this “Durga pujo voting method” makes us the
most useful. We decided to do it as a minor project. The main challenge is
to establish a link between the database and the PHP script. And that
makes us more excited about this Project.
 We are still researching to make this theme project more lucrative. For
that, we are following some blogs and documentation on PHP. And also
planning to add some graphics animation to this page using JavaScript
Library, later on.
 This is a stand-alone Project and can be customized based on any puja
theme, as well as a simple voting system also for college elections.
 The limitation is the database capacity. But, this can be solved by Cloud
Services.

# MOTIVATION OF THE PROJECT

best pujo to win the prize.
